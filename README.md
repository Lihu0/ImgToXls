Takes an image and converts its pixels into an Excel sheet. Each pixel's red, green, and blue values are displayed vertically within the same column, like this:

| Pixel 1  | Pixel 2  | Pixel 3  | Pixel 4  |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Red      | Red      | Red      | Red      |
| Green    | Green    | Green    | Green    |
| Blue     | Blue     | Blue     | Blue     |

| Pixel 5  | Pixel 6  | Pixel 7  | Pixel 8  |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Red      | Red      | Red      | Red      |
| Green    | Green    | Green    | Green    |
| Blue     | Blue     | Blue     | Blue     |
